Welcome to Halloween Hallows! This is an event park that allows you to create an account, select an event, and save it to your own unique list of events! But be careful, this little application has a couple of funny easter eggs. Use at your own risk! Upon downloading you must run these commands -

    -brew install ruby
    -bundle install
 
 Once you've done that, enter ruby runner.rb 
 Your're in! Enjoy!
